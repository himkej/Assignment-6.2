  where zipcode>300000 and zipcode<399999;

2)Select substring(date,7),max(temperature)
  from temperature_data
  group by substring(date,7);

3)Select substring(date,7),max(temperature)
  from temperature_data
  group by substring(date,7)
  having count(*)>1;
4)create view temperature_data_vw
  Select substring(date,7),max(temperature)
  from temperature_data
  group by substring(date,7)
  having count(*)>1;
5)INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/acadgild/Hive/'
